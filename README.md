This study introduces a novel theoretical framework that reinterprets three-dimensional (3D) physical phenomena through the concept of a higher-dimensional informational mass (I). The model, termed the Abstract Information Model, integrates four components: Hue (H), Saturation (S), Brightness (B), and Contrast (C) to offer a novel perspective on physical reality. Hue represents fundamental forces, Saturation measures energy and conserved quantities, Brightness reflects field intensities, and Contrast (still in development) aims to model spatial and temporal variations.
The framework builds on established theories such as Claude Shannonâ€™s information theory and the Holographic Principle.
